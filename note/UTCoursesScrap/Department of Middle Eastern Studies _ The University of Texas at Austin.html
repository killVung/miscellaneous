<h1 class="page-title">Department of Middle Eastern Studies</h1>


<p>Before enrolling for the first time in any language offered by the Department of Middle Eastern Studies, all students with knowledge of the language, however acquired, must be tested to determine the course for which they should register. Information about the tests is available from the departmental undergraduate adviser. The Department of Middle Eastern Studies considers students educated in a Middle Eastern language beyond the elementary school level to be native speakers of that language.</p>




<p>The information in parentheses after a course number is the Texas Common Course Numbering (TCCN) designation. Only TCCN designations that are exact semester-hour equivalents of University courses are listed here. Additional TCCN information is given in <a href="http://catalog.utexas.edu/undergraduate/appendix-a/" target="_blank">Appendix A</a>. &nbsp;</p>
