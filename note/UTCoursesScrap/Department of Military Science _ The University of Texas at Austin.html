<h1 class="page-title">Department of Military Science</h1>


<p>The Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) was established at the University of Texas in September, 1947. As a senior division unit, it is designed to provide a course of military instruction that will permit qualified students to prepare themselves for commissions as second lieutenants while they pursue other academic courses leading to baccalaureate or advanced degrees from the University.</p>




<p>Upon being commissioned a second lieutenant, each student has the opportunity to serve in the active Army, Army Reserve, or National Guard.</p>




<p>The Army ROTC program, in addition to providing a basic foundation in military subjects, is designed to develop the highest qualities of leadership, character, and citizenship through the wide variety of extracurricular activities it sponsors. Such activities include parades, ceremonies, social events, a Ranger detachment, and intramural athletic teams.</p>




<p>The Army ROTC program is normally a four-year program divided into a basic course and an advanced course. The basic course is conducted during the first two years and the advanced course during the last two years. Certain students may qualify for advanced placement in the program based on previous military training in Junior ROTC, a service academy, active duty in a military service, credit for other college courses, or completion of a special four-week summer camp, normally between the sophomore and junior year.</p>




<p>The Department of the Army has determined that a need exists for all Army ROTC cadets to have a demonstrated proficiency in selected disciplines. These courses are called Professional Military Education (PME) and must be completed prior to graduation. A list of courses that fulfill PME requirements is available from the chair of the Department of Military Science.</p>




<p>Two-, three-, and four-year scholarship programs are offered to selected cadets. The four-year scholarship program is administered by the Department of the Army, but selection is based on the Professor of Military Science Order of Merit List (OML). Applicants must apply while in high school. The remaining programs are administered directly through the Department of Military Science.</p>




<p>Scholarship students receive $300 to $500 a month for up to ten months for each year of their scholarship. The scholarship pays for required tuition and mandatory fees, laboratory expenses, and books. Nonscholarship students receive $450 to $500 a month during the advanced course. For additional information, contact the scholarship and enrollment officer&nbsp;at <a href="mailto:arotc@uts.cc.utexas.edu">arotc@uts.cc.utexas.edu</a> or <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/arotc" target="_blank">http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/arotc</a>.</p>
